# Final-Project CS675 Machine Learning 
Group members: Chenyu Zhang, Mengmeng Liu, Anzhe Xiao, Zepeng Hu

The dataset has 315 bird species and we select the first 100 species for our classification task due to computing resource limit. There are originally 45980 training images, 1575 testing images (5 images per species) and 1575 validation images (5 images per species). Each figure has 224 Ã— 224 resolution. Two image preprocessing techniques (Data Transformation & Dimension Reduction (PCA)) are adopted before training. VGG, Resnet and MobileNet are applied on this task.
